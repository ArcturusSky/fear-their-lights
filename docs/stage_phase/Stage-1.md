# Stage 1

We worked together in the past it was going well and since we are sharing interests we decided to work again together
José is a student and this will be his first big project
Strenght: Lot of free time
interest: Like anime and manga and video game

Arc student too, first big interesting project
Strenght: very dedicated and perfectionnist
Interest: Like video game and medievals fairs

## Assign roles:

Arc - Project Manager
José - Employee of the month 

## Communication

Discord, Notions (see the section about it in the README.md)

## Task:

Various ideas during brainstorm:
- Tripadvisor of toilet
- A game in web-browser, here are the various ideas we had:
  -  **Light Worms (Glow.io)**  
     - Players control glowing worms in a dark arena.  
     - Collect light orbs to grow and stay alive.  
     - Avoid colliding with other worms or losing all light.

  - **Orbital Chaos**  
     - Players control objects that orbit a central planet.  
     - Collide with opponents’ orbits to knock them off while maintaining balance.  
     - Strategic timing and positioning are key.

  - **Garden Cooperative (Grow.io)**  
     - Players work together to grow a virtual garden.  
     - Collect resources and defend the garden from pests.  
     - Balance cooperation and competition for the best score.

  - **Tidal Clash**  
     - Players control boats on a map with dynamic water currents.  
     - Capture floating resources and avoid whirlpools.  
     - Push opponents into hazards for tactical advantage.

We didn't needed really to scored them since we quickly ended up choosing what we wanted and why and here is the breakdown:

- Tripadvisor of toilet: Doeable alone and not very interesting, keept for personnal project by Arc since it was my first idea
- Light Worms (kinda selected, see below)
- Orbital Chaos: rejected because managing gravity and physics can be very tricky and lead to lot of complexity
- Tidal Clash: Linda the same about the water and also, seen and seen again.
- Garden Cooperative: To have something **interesting** the MVP would need a LOT of various fonctionnalities, far mor than our chosen solution.

"Winner": Light worms

Actually, we started on that idea, but thought it was too close to the regular "Snake" but we liked the idea of  being in the dark it was more original than various other game and then we tought "hey what about a battle Royal but in the dark?"

Battle royal is quite a "safe" choice since the base is easy (x amount of player, killing each other, one surviving) and it's very popular since it's trigerring competitivity.

Then we discussed the main functionnalities "MVP":

- 🕹️ **Game Features:**
  - 👥 **Multiplayer**: Up to 10-15 players per map.
  - 🗺️ **Map divided into a chessboard**: The areas self-destruct and become inaccessible, with geometric decorations to hide.
  - 🗡️ **Combat system**: Melee weapons with hitbox management.
  - ⏱️ **Time**: Game time management.
  - 🔦 **Lighting**: Flashlight for each player since the map is in the dark.
  - 🏆 **Scoreboard**: Display of scores in real time.
  - 🎨 **Basic gamedesign**: Basic aesthetic to begin with.
  
- 🖥️ **Non-Game Features:**
  - 📊 **Navigation menu**: Smooth and intuitive user interface.
  - 🔐 **User account management**:
    - Account creation with email.
    - Account deletion.
    - Password reset and change.

- 🚀 **Post-MVP Features**
  - ❤️ **Life bar**: Monitoring the status of players.
  - 🔫 **Firearms**: Added various weapons to diversify the gameplay. (to be debated)
  - 👨‍🚀 **Character Classes**: Assassin, Soldier, Tank for varied play styles.
  - 💪 **Power-ups**: Temporary increase in life, armor, damage, speed, lighting.
  - 🎵 **Improved animations and scenery** to enrich the visual experience.
  - 🏆 **Additional game modes**: Solo, Team vs Team, Respawn.
  - 👹 **Boss (The Night Hunter)**: An additional challenge for players.
