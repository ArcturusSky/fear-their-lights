## Introduction

In this stage we will document the creation of the prototype and the various architecture of our project. This stage will be also useful to rework on the technologies and really think them interacting with each other and taking also in count deadlines and the technologies we saw during the Holberton course.

### Purpose of this document

This document will be important because it will be the prototype, the big guidelines to "how" we will code.

### Project overview

As a reminder: This project is a video game playable on a browser.
The concept is a "Battle royal" completly in the dark. Players will have to be tactical and cautious to be able to reach each other without being caught themselves.

### MVP scope
